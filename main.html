	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity measures the efficiency of an algorithm by analyzing how
		the number of operations grows with the size of the input. An efficient algorithm 
		aims to minimize this growth, ensuring faster execution times as input sizes increase. Understanding and optimizing time complexity is essential for building scalable solutions.</p>
	<p><strong>Space complexity</strong> evaluates the amount of memory an algorithm consumes during execution, often represented using Big-O notation. For instance, an algorithm with a Space Complexity of O(n) uses additional memory proportional to the input size 
ùëõ
n. Optimizing space complexity helps conserve system resources and improves overall application performance.</p>
